Each project has specific budget allocations that you can review before donating.
faq.q2.question=Is my donation tax-deductible?
faq.q2.answer=Yes, CareForAll is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and all donations made by U.S. taxpayers are tax-deductible to the extent allowed by law. You will receive a tax receipt for your donation.
faq.q3.question=Can I volunteer instead of donating money?
faq.q3.answer=Absolutely! We welcome volunteers both locally and internationally. We have various opportunities ranging from administrative support to field work depending on your skills and availability. Visit our Volunteer page to learn more about current opportunities and how to apply.
faq.q4.question=How can I stay updated on how my donation is being used?
